# simple_linear_regression_model
This project offers you a linear regression model in python, a great statistical model for predictions.

## What's the use ?
* Overoming a lacking dataset by completing it
* Predicting data out of our range of time
 
## How does it work ?
* The model is trained to recognize the logical progression of a dataset and therefore giving predictions on data it has never came accross.
In other words, the model doesn't "memorize" but "generalize" the data it has learnt.

## Usage case
* Predict the price of a car based on its mileage
* Predict the height of a specfic plant based on its age
* Predict the cancer cell count of a patient based on the timeframe of cancer
